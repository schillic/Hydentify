  bmc_pick_state - Picks a state from the set of initial states

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

   bmc_pick_state [-h] [-v] ] [-c "constraint" | -s trace.state]

   Chooses an element from the set of initial states, and makes it the
   current state (replacing the old one). The chosen state is stored as the
   first state of a new trace ready to be lengthened by steps states by the
   bmc_simulate or bmc_inc_simulate commands. A constraint can be provided to
   restrict the set of candidate states.

   Command Options:

   -v
           Verbosely prints out chosen state (all state variables, otherwise
           it prints out only the label t.1 of the state chosen, where t is
           the number of the new trace, that is the number of traces so far
           generated plus one).

   -c "constraint"
           Uses constraint to restrict the set of initial states in which the
           state has to be picked.

   -s trace.state
           Picks state from trace.state label. A new simulation trace will be
           created by copying prefix of the source trace up to specified
           state.
