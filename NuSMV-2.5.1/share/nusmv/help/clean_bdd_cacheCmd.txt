  clean_bdd_cache - Cleans the cache used during evaluation of expressions to
  ADD and BDD representations.

   clean_bdd_cache [-h]

   During conversion of symbolic (node_ptr) expressions to ADD and BDD
   representations the results of evaluations are normally cached (see
   additionally NuSMV option enable_bdd_cache). This allows to save time by
   avoid the construction of BDD for the same expression several time. In
   some situations it may be preferable to clean the cache and free collected
   ADD and BDD. This operation can be done, for example, to free some memory.
   Another possible reason is that dynamic reordering may modify all existing
   BDDs, and cleaning the cache thereby freeing the BDD may speed up the
   reordering. This command is designed specifically to free the internal
   cache of evaluated expressions and their ADDs and BDDs. Note that only the
   cache of exp-to-bdd evaluator is freed. BDDs of variables, constants and
   expressions collected in BDD FSM or anywhere else are not touched.
