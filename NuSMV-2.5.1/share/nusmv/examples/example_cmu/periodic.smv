-- A data driven pipeline example.
--
-- Three pipelines are implemented, p1, p2 and p3. Each has three phases.
-- The execution times and periods are described at the beginning of each
-- phase. By commenting out/uncommenting lines in the main module the
-- example can be made data driven or synchronized. A data driven pipeline
-- is one in which the next phase is ready to execute when the previous
-- one finishes. In the synchronized one all phases only execute according
-- to their periodicity, independent of data availability.
