<h3>write_order - Writes variable order to file.</h3>
<hr>
<code>write_order [-h] [-b] [(-o | -f) order-file]</code><p>
Writes the current order of BDD variables in the
  file specified via the -o option. If no option is specified the environment
  variable <tt>output_order_file</tt> will be considered. If the variable
  <tt>output_order_file</tt> is unset (or set to an empty value) then standard
  output will be used. The option <tt>-b</tt> forces the dumped
  variable ordering to contain only boolean variables.
  All the scalar variables will be substituted by those variables bits
  that encode them.  The variables bits will occur within the dumped
  variable ordering depending on the position they have within the
  system when the command is executed.
  <p>
  Command options:<p>
  <dl>
    <dt> <tt>-b</tt>
       <dd> Dumps bits of scalar variables instead of the single
       scalar variables. When specified, this option temporary
       overloads the current value of the system variable
       <tt>write_order_dumps_bits</tt>.

    <dt> <tt>-o order-file</tt>
       <dd> Sets the environment variable <tt>output_order_file</tt>
       to <tt>order-file</tt> and then dumps the ordering list into that file.
    <dt> <tt>-f order-file</tt>
       <dd> Alias for -o option. Supplied for backward compatibility.
