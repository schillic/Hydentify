<h3>quit - exits NuSMV</h3>
<hr>
<code>quit [-h] [-s] [-x]</code><p>
Stops the program.  Does not save the current network
  before exiting.<p>

  Command options:<p>
  <dl>
     <dt> -s
     <dd> Frees all the used memory before quitting.
          This is slower, and it is used for finding memory leaks.
     <dt> -x
     <dd> Leave immediately. Skip all the cleanup code, leave it to
          the OS. This can save quite a long time.
