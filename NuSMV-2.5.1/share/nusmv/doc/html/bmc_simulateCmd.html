<h3>bmc_simulate - Generates a trace of the model from 0 (zero) to k</h3>
<hr>
<code>bmc_simulate [-h | [-p | -v] -k <length>]</code><p>
bmc_simulate does not require a specification
  to build the problem, because only the model is used to build it.
  The problem length is represented by the <i>-k</i> command parameter,
  or by its default value stored in the environment variable
  <i>bmc_length</i>.<BR>
  Command options:<p>
  <dl>
    <dt> <tt>-p </tt>
    <dd> prints out the generated trace, with only variables whose
    values had changed.
    <dt> <tt>-v </tt>
    <dd> verbosely prints out the generated trace. All assignments will be
    printed.
    <dt> <tt>-k <i> length</i></tt>
    <dd> <i>length</i> is the number of simulation steps.
  </dl>
