This package provides an implementation of sets.
  It is possible to perform the test of equality among two sets in
  constant time by simply comparing the two sets. Thus it is possible
  to check if a union has increased the cardinality of a set inserting
  elements in one of the two operands by simply comparing the
  result of the union among the operands.
