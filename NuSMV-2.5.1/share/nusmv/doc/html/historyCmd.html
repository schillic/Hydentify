<h3>history - list previous commands and their event numbers</h3>
<hr>
<code>history [-h] [&lt;num&gt;]</code><p>
Lists previous commands and their event numbers.
  This is a UNIX-like history mechanism inside the NuSMV shell.<p>
  Command options:<p>
  <dl>
     <dt> &lt;num&gt;
         <dd> Lists the last &lt;num&gt; events.  Lists the last 30
              events if &lt;num&gt; is not specified.
  </dl><p>

  History Substitution:<p>

  The history substitution mechanism is a simpler version of the csh history
  substitution mechanism.  It enables you to reuse words from previously typed
  commands.<p>

  The default history substitution character is the `%' (`!' is default for
  shell escapes, and `#' marks the beginning of a comment). This can be changed
  using the "set" command. In this description '%' is used as the history_char.
  The `%' can appear anywhere in a line.  A line containing a history
  substitution is echoed to the screen after the substitution takes place.
  `%' can be preceded by a `\' in order to escape the substitution,
  for example, to enter a `%' into an alias or to set the prompt.<br><p>

  Each valid line typed at the prompt is saved.  If the "history" variable
  is set (see help page for "set"), each line is also echoed to the history
  file.  You can use the "history" command to list the previously typed
  commands. <p>

  Substitutions: <p>

  At any point in a line these history substitutions are
  available.<p>
        <dl><dt>%:0   <dd>  Initial word of last command.</dl>
        <dl><dt>%:n   <dd>   n-th argument of last command.</dl>
        <dl><dt>%$    <dd>   Last argument of last command.</dl>
        <dl><dt>%*    <dd>   All but initial word of last command.</dl>

        <dl><dt>%%    <dd>   Last command.</dl>
        <dl><dt>%stuf <dd>   Last command beginning with "stuf".</dl>
        <dl><dt>%n    <dd>   Repeat the n-th command.</dl>
        <dl><dt>%-n   <dd>   Repeat the n-th previous command.</dl>
        <dl><dt>^old^new  <dd>       Replace "old" with "new" in previous command.
        Trailing spaces are significant during substitution.
        Initial spaces are not significant.</dl>
