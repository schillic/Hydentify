<h3>check_pslspec - Performs fair PSL model checking.</h3>
<hr>
<code>check_pslspec [-h] [-m | -o output-file] [-n number | -p "psl-expr [IN context]" | -P "name"] [-b|-s [-i] [-c] [-N] [-g] [-1] [-k bmc_length] [-l loopback]]</code><p>
Performs fair PSL model checking.<p>

  A <tt>psl-expr</tt> to be checked can be specified at command line 
  using option <tt>-p</tt>. Alternatively, option <tt>-n</tt> can be used
  for checking a particular formula in the property database. If 
  neither <tt>-n</tt> nor <tt>-p</tt> are used, all the PSLSPEC formulas in
  the database are checked.<p>

  Command options:<p>
  <dl>
    <dt> <tt>-m</tt>
       <dd> Pipes the output generated by the command in processing
           <tt>SPEC</tt>s to the program specified by the
           <tt>PAGER</tt> shell variable if defined, else
           through the <tt>UNIX</tt> command "more".
    <dt> <tt>-o output-file</tt>
       <dd> Writes the output generated by the command in processing
           <tt>PSLSPEC</tt>s to the file <tt>output-file</tt>.
    <dt> <tt>-p "psl-expr [IN context]"</tt>
       <dd> A PSL formula to be checked. <tt>context</tt> is the module 
       instance name which the variables in <tt>ctl-expr</tt> must 
       be evaluated in.       
    <dt> <tt>-n number</tt>
       <dd> Checks the PSL property with index <tt>number</tt> in the property
            database. 
    <dt> <tt>-P name</tt>
       <dd> Checks the PSL property named <tt>name</tt> in the property
            database. 

    <dt> <tt>-b</tt> When specified, the BMC engine will be used for
    checking those PSL properties that can be converted to LTL
    specifications. The SAT solver to be used will be chosen according
    to the current value of the system variable sat_solver. Non-LTL
    properties will be ignored.

    <dt> <tt>-s</tt> When specified, the SBMC engine will be used for
    checking those PSL properties that can be converted to LTL
    specifications. The SAT solver to be used will be chosen according
    to the current value of the system variable sat_solver. Non-LTL
    properties will be ignored.

    <dt> <tt>-i</tt> Uses incremental SAT solving when this feature is
    available. This option must be mandatorily used in combination
    with the option -b.

    <dt> <tt>-c</tt> Performs completeness check. This option can be
    used only in combination with -s. This options implies also -i

    <dt> <tt>-N</tt> Does not perform virtual unrolling. This option can be
    used only in combination with -s. This options implies also -i


    <dt> <tt>-g</tt> While solving a problem, dumps it as a DIMACS
    file whose name depends on the content of the system variable
    "bmc_dimacs_filename". This feature is not allowed when the option
    -i is used as well. 

    <dt> <tt>-1</tt> Generates and solves a single problem instead of 
    iterating through 0 and bmc_length. 

    <dt> <tt>-k <i>bmc_length</i></tt>
       <dd> <i>bmc_length</i> is the maximum problem bound must be reached if 
       the option -1 is not specified. If -1 is specified, <i>bmc_length</i> is 
       the exact length of the problem to be generated. 
       Only natural number are valid values for this option. If no value 
       is given the environment variable <i>bmc_length</i> is considered 
       instead. 
    <dt> <tt>-l <i>loopback</i></tt>
       <dd> <i>loopback</i> value may be: <BR>
       - a natural number in (0, <i>bmc_length-1</i>). Positive sign ('+') can 
       be also used as prefix of the number. Any invalid combination of length
       and loopback will be skipped during the generation/solving process.<BR>
       - a negative number in (-1, -<i>bmc_length</i>). In this case 
       <i>loopback</i> is considered a value relative to <i>bmc_length</i>. 
       Any invalid combination of length and loopback will be skipped 
       during the generation/solving process.<BR>
       - the symbol 'X', which means "no loopback" <BR>
       - the symbol '*', which means "all possible loopback from zero to 
       <i>bmc_length-1</i>"
