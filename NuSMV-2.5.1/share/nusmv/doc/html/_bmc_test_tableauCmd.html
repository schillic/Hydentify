<h3>_bmc_test_tableau - Generates a random formula to logically test the equivalent tableau</h3>
<hr>
<code>_bmc_test_tableau [-h] | [-n property_index] | [[ -d max_depth] [-c max_conns] [-o operator]]</code><p>
Use this hidden command to generate random formulae and
  to test the equivalent tableau. The first time this command is called in the
  current NuSMV session it creates a new smv file with a model and generates a
  random ltl spec to test tableau.
  The following times it is called it appends a new formula to the file.
  The generated model contains the same number of non-deterministic variables
  the currently model loaded into NuSMV contains. <BR>
  You cannot call this command if the bmc_loopback is set to '*' (all loops).
