<h3>process_model - Performs the batch steps and then returns control to the interactive shell.</h3>
<hr>
<code>process_model [-h] [-f] [-r] [-i model-file] [-m Method]</code><p>
Reads the model, compiles it into BDD and
  performs the model checking of all the specification contained in
  it. If the environment variable <tt>forward_search</tt> has been set
  before, then the set of reachable states is computed. If the
  option <tt>-r</tt> is specified, the reordering of variables is
  performed accordingly. This command simulates the batch behavior of
  NuSMV and then returns the control to the interactive shell.<p>

  Command options:<p>
  <dl>
    <dt> <tt>-f</tt>
       <dd> Forces model construction even when COI is enabled.
    <dt> <tt>-r</tt>
       <dd> Performs a variable ordering at the end of the
       computation, and dumps the variable ordering as the command
       line option <tt>-reorder</tt> does.
    <dt> <tt>-i model-file</tt>
       <dd> Sets the environment variable <tt>input_file</tt> to file
           <tt>model-file</tt>, and reads the model from file
           <tt>model-file</tt>.
    <dt> <tt>-m Method</tt>
       <dd> Sets the environment variable <tt>partition_method</tt> to
       <tt>Method</tt> and uses it as partitioning method.
