<h3>set - Sets an environment variable</h3>
<hr>
<code>set [-h] [&lt;name&gt;] [&lt;value&gt;]</code><p>
A variable environment is maintained by the command 
   interpreter.
   The "set" command sets a variable to a particular value, and the
   "unset" command removes the definition of a variable.
   If "set" is given no arguments, it prints the current value of all variables.<p>

   Command options:<p>
   <dl> <dt> -h
   <dd> Prints the command usage.
   </dl>
   <dl> <dt> &lt;name&gt;
   <dd> Variable name
   </dl>
   <dl> <dt> &lt;value&gt;
   <dd> Value to be assigned to the variable.
   </dl>

   <p>
   Interpolation of variables is allowed when using the set command. The
   variables are referred to with the prefix of '$'. So for example, 
   what follows can be done to check the value of a set variable:<br>
   <code>
   NuSMV> set foo bar<br>
   NuSMV> echo $foo<br>
   bar <br>
   </code>
  
   The last line "bar" will be the output produced by NuSMV.<p>

   Variables can be extended by using the character ':' to concatenate
   values. For example: <br>
   <code>
   NuSMV> set foo bar<br>
   NuSMV> set foo $foo:foobar<br>
   NuSMV> echo $foo<br>
   bar:foobar<br>
   </code>
   The variable <code> foo </code> is extended with the value <code>
   foobar </code>. <p>
  
   Whitespace characters may be present within quotes. However, variable
   interpolation lays the restriction that the characters ':' and '/' may
   not be used within quotes. This is to allow for recursive interpolation.
   So for example, the following is allowed<br>
   <code>
   NuSMV> set "foo bar" this<br>
   NuSMV> echo $"foo bar"<br>
   this <br>
   </code> 
   The last line will be the output produced by NuSMV. <br>
   But in the following, the  value of the variable <code> foo/bar </code>
   will not be interpreted correctly:<p>
   <code>
   NuSMV> set "foo/bar" this<br>
   NuSMV> echo $"foo/bar"<br>
   foo/bar<br>
   </code>
   If a variable is not set by the "set" command, then the variable is returned
   unchanged.
   <p>

   Different commands use environment information for different purposes.
   The command interpreter makes use of the following parameters:<p>

   <dl>
   <dt><b>autoexec</b>
   <dd>     Defines a command string to be automatically executed after every 
   command processed by the command interpreter.
   This is useful for things like timing commands, or tracing the 
   progress of optimization.
   </dl>


   <dl><dt><b>open_path</b>
   <dd>      "open_path" (in analogy to the shell-variable PATH) is a list of
   colon-separated strings giving directories to be searched whenever
   a file is opened for read.  Typically the current directory (.) is
   the first item in this list. The standard system library (typically 
   $NuSMV_LIBRARY_PATH) is always implicitly appended to the current 
   path.
   This provides a convenient short-hand mechanism for reaching 
   standard library files.
   </dl>
   <dl><dt> <b>nusmv_stderr </b>
   <dd>   Standard error (normally stderr) can be re-directed to a file
   by setting the variable nusmv_stderr.
   </dl>           

   <dl><dt>  <b>nusmv_stdout</b>
   <dd>           Standard output (normally stdout) can be re-directed to a file
   by setting the variable nusmv_stdout.
   </dl>
