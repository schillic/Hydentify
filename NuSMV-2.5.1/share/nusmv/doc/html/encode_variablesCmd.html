<h3>encode_variables - Builds the BDD variables necessary to compile the model into BDD.</h3>
<hr>
<code>encode_variables [-h] [-i order-file]</code><p>
Generates the boolean BDD variables and the ADD needed to encode
  propositionally the (symbolic) variables declared in the model.<br>

  The variables are created as default in the order in which they
  appear in a depth first traversal of the hierarchy.<p>

  The input order file can be partial and can contain variables not
  declared in the model. Variables not declared in the model are
  simply discarded. Variables declared in the model which are not
  listed in the ordering input file will be created and appended at the
  end of the given ordering list, according to the default ordering.<p>

  Command options:<p>
  <dl>
    <dt> <tt>-i order-file</tt>
       <dd> Sets the environment variable <tt>input_order_file</tt> to
       <tt>order-file</tt>, and reads the variable ordering to be used from
       file <tt>order-file</tt>. This can be combined with the
       <tt>write_order</tt> command. The variable ordering is written to a
       file, which can be inspected and reordered by the user, and then
       read back in.
