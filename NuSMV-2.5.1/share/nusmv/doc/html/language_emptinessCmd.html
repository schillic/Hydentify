<h3>language_emptiness - Checks for language emptiness.</h3>
<hr>
<code>language_emptiness [-h] [-v] [-a]</code><p>
Checks for the language emptiness. <br>

  If <tt>-a</tt> is given the check is performed by verifying whether
  all initial states are included in the set of fair states. If it is
  the case from all initial states there exists a fair path and thus
  the language is not empty. On the other hand, if no <tt>-a</tt> is
  specified, the check is performed by verifying whether there exists
  at least one inital state that is also a fair state. In this case
  there is an initial state from which it starts a fair path and thus
  the lnaguage is not empty.

  if <tt>-v</tt> is specified, then some information on the set of
  initial states is printed out too.
