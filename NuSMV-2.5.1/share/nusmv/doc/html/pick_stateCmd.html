<h3>pick_state - Picks a state from the set of initial states</h3>
<hr>
<code>pick_state [-h] [-v] [-r | -i [-a]] [-c "constraints"]</code><p>
Chooses an element from the set of initial states, and makes it the
  <tt>current state</tt> (replacing the old one). The chosen state is
  stored as the first state of a new trace ready to be lengthened by
  <tt>steps</tt> states by the <tt>simulate</tt> command. The state can be
  chosen according to different policies which can be specified via command
  line options. By default the state is chosen in a deterministic way.
  <p>
  Command Options:<p>
  <dl>
    <dt> <tt>-v</tt>
       <dd> Verbosely prints out chosen state (all state variables, otherwise
       it prints out only the label <tt>t.1</tt> of the state chosen, where
       <tt>t</tt> is the number of the new trace, that is the number of
       traces so far generated plus one).
    <dt> <tt>-r</tt>
       <dd> Randomly picks a state from the set of initial states.
    <dt> <tt>-i</tt>
       <dd> Enables the user to interactively pick up an initial state. The
       user is requested to choose a state from a list of possible items
       (every item in the list doesn't show state variables unchanged with
       respect to a previous item). If the number of possible states is too
       high, then the user has to specify some further constraints as
       "simple expression".
    <dt> <tt>-a</tt>
       <dd> Displays all state variables (changed and unchanged with respect
       to a previous item) in an interactive picking. This option
       works only if the <tt>-i</tt> options has been specified.
    <dt> <tt>-c "constraints"</tt>
       <dd> Uses <tt>constraints</tt> to restrict the set of initial states
       in which the state has to be picked.
