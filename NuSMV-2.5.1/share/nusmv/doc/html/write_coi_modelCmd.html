<h3>write_coi_model - Writes a flat model of SMV file, restricted to the COI of the model properties</h3>
<hr>
<code>write_coi_model [-h] [-o filename] [-n <prop> | -p <expr> | -P <name>] | [-c] | [-l] | [-i] | [-s] | [-q] | [-p expr] | [-C] | [-g]</code><p>
Writes the currently loaded SMV model in the
  specified file, after having flattened it. If a property is
  specified, the dumped model is the result of applying the COI over
  that property. otherwise, a restricted SMV model is dumped for each
  property in the property database.

  Processes are eliminated and a corresponding equivalent model is
  printed out.

  If no file is specified, stderr is used for output
