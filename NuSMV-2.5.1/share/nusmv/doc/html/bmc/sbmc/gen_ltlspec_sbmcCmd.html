<h3>gen_ltlspec_sbmc - Dumps into one or more dimacs files the given LTL specification, or all LTL specifications if no formula is given. Generation and dumping parameters are the maximum bound and the loopback values. Uses Kepa's and Timo's method for doing bmc.</h3>
<hr>
<code>gen_ltlspec_sbmc [-h | -n idx | -p "formula" [IN context] | -P "name"] [-k max_length] [-l loopback] [-1] [-o filename]</code><p>
This command generates one or more problems, and
  dumps each problem into a dimacs file. Each problem is related to a specific
  problem bound, which increases from zero (0) to the given maximum problem
  bound. In this short description "<i>length</i>" is the bound of the
  problem that system is going to dump out. Uses Kepa's and Timo's method for doing bmc. <BR>
  In this context the maximum problem bound is represented by the
  <i>max_length</i> parameter, or by its default value stored in the
  environment variable <i>bmc_length</i>.<BR>
  Each dumped problem also depends on the loopback you can explicitly
  specify by the <i>-l</i> option, or by its default value stored in the
  environment variable <i>bmc_loopback</i>. <BR>
  The property to be checked may be specified using the <i>-n idx</i> or
  the <i>-p "formula"</i> options. <BR>
  You may specify dimacs file name by using the option <i>-o "filename"</i>,
  otherwise the default value stored in the environment variable
  <i>bmc_dimacs_filename</i> will be considered.<BR>
  <p>
  Command options:<p>
  <dl>
    <dt> <tt>-n <i>index</i></tt>
       <dd> <i>index</i> is the numeric index of a valid LTL specification
       formula actually located in the properties database. <BR>
    <dt> <tt>-p "formula" [IN context]</tt>
       <dd> Checks the <tt>formula</tt> specified on the command-line. <BR>
            <tt>context</tt> is the module instance name which the variables
            in <tt>formula</tt> must be evaluated in.
    <dt> <tt>-P name</tt>
       <dd> Checks the LTLSPEC property with name <tt>name</tt> in the property
            database.
    <dt> <tt>-k <i>max_length</i></tt>
       <dd> <i>max_length</i> is the maximum problem bound must be reached.
       Only natural number are valid values for this option. If no value
       is given the environment variable <i>bmc_length</i> is considered
       instead.
    <dt> <tt>-l <i>loopback</i></tt>
       <dd> <i>loopback</i> value may be: <BR>
       - a natural number in (0, <i>max_length-1</i>). Positive sign ('+') can
       be also used as prefix of the number. Any invalid combination of length
       and loopback will be skipped during the generation/solving process.<BR>
       - a negative number in (-1, -<i>bmc_length</i>). In this case
       <i>loopback</i> is considered a value relative to <i>max_length</i>.
       Any invalid combination of length and loopback will be skipped
       during the generation/solving process.<BR>
       - the symbol 'X', which means "no loopback" <BR>
       - the symbol '*', which means "all possible loopback from zero to
       <i>length-1</i>"
    <dt> <tt>-1</tt>
       <dd> Generates a single problem with length <tt>k</tt>
    <dt> <tt>-o <i>filename</i></tt>
       <dd> <i>filename</i> is the name of the dumped dimacs file.
       It may contain special symbols which will be macro-expanded to form
       the real file name. Possible symbols are: <BR>
       - @F: model name with path part <BR>
       - @f: model name without path part <BR>
       - @k: current problem bound <BR>
       - @l: current loopback value <BR>
       - @n: index of the currently processed formula in the properties
       database <BR>
       - @@: the '@' character
  </dl>
