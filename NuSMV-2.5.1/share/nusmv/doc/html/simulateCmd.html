<h3>simulate - Performs a simulation from the current selected state</h3>
<hr>
<code>simulate [-h] [-p | -v] [-r | -i [-a]] [[-c "constraints"] | [-t "constraints"]</code><p>
Generates a sequence of at most <tt>steps</tt> states (representing a
  possible execution of the model), starting from the <em>current state</em>.
  The current state must be set via the <em>pick_state</em> or
  <em>goto_state</em> commands.<p>
  It is possible to run the simulation in three ways (according to different
  command line policies):
  deterministic (the default mode), random and interactive.<p>
  The resulting sequence is stored in a trace indexed with an integer number
  taking into account the total number of traces stored in the system. There is
  a different behavior in the way traces are built, according to how
  <em>current state</em> is set: <em>current state</em> is always put at
  the beginning of a new trace (so it will contain at most <it>steps + 1</it>
  states) except when it is the last state of an existent old trace.
  In this case the old trace is lengthened by at most <it>steps</it> states.
  <p>
  Command Options:<p>
  <dl>
    <dt> <tt>-p</tt>
       <dd> Prints current generated trace (only those variables whose value
       changed from the previous state).
    <dt> <tt>-v</tt>
       <dd> Verbosely prints current generated trace (changed and unchanged
       state variables).
    <dt> <tt>-r</tt>
       <dd> Picks a state from a set of possible future states in a random way.
    <dt> <tt>-i</tt>
       <dd> Enables the user to interactively choose every state of the trace,
       step by step. If the number of possible states is too high, then
       the user has to specify some constraints as simple expression.
       These constraints are used only for a single simulation step and
       are <em>forgotten</em> in the following ones. They are to be intended
       in an opposite way with respect to those constraints eventually entered
       with the pick_state command, or during an interactive simulation
       session (when the number of future states to be displayed is too high),
       that are <em>local</em> only to a single step of the simulation and
       are <em>forgotten</em> in the next one.
    <dt> <tt>-a</tt>
       <dd> Displays all the state variables (changed and unchanged) during
       every step of an interactive session. This option works only if the
       <tt>-i</tt> option has been specified.
    <dt> <tt>-c "constraints"</tt>
       <dd> Performs a simulation in which computation is restricted to states
       satisfying those <tt>constraints</tt>. The desired sequence of states
       could not exist if such constraints were too strong or it may happen
       that at some point of the simulation a future state satisfying those
       constraints doesn't exist: in that case a trace with a number of
       states less than <tt>steps</tt> trace is obtained.
    <dt> <tt>-t "constraints"</tt>
       <dd> Performs a simulation in which computation is restricted to states
       satisfying those <tt>constraints</tt>. The desired sequence of states
       could not exist if such constraints were too strong or it may happen
       that at some point of the simulation a future state satisfying those
       constraints doesn't exist: in that case a trace with a number of
       states less than <tt>steps</tt> trace is obtained.
    <dt> <tt>steps</tt>
       <dd> Maximum length of the path according to the constraints.
       The length of a trace could contain less than <tt>steps</tt> states:
       this is the case in which simulation stops in an intermediate
       step because it may not exist any future state satisfying those
       constraints.
