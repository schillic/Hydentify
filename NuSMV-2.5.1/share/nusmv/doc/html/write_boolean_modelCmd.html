<h3>write_boolean_model - Writes a flattened and booleanized model of a given SMV file</h3>
<hr>
<code>write_boolean_model [-h] [-o filename]</code><p>
Writes the currently loaded SMV model in the
  specified file, after having flattened and booleanized it. Processes
  are eliminated and a corresponding equivalent model is printed
  out.

  If no file is specified, the file specified via the environment
  variable <tt>output_boolean_model_file</tt> is used if any,
  otherwise standard output is used.
  <p>
  Command options:<p>
  <dl>
     <dt><tt>-o filename</tt>
       <dd> Attempts to write the flat and boolean SMV model in
       <tt>filename</tt>.
  </dl>

  ** New in 2.4.0 and later **
  Scalar variables are dumped as DEFINEs whose body is their boolean
  encoding.

  This allows the user to still express and see parts of the generated
  boolean model in terms of the original model's scalar variables
  names and values, and still keeping the generated model purely boolean.

  Also, symbolic constants are dumped within a CONSTANTS statement to
  declare the values of the original scalar variables' for future
  reading of the generated file.
